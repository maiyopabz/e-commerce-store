# e-commerce-store

I created a Mobile first responsive Ecommerce Website. Tools I used Html, Css and Javascript. 
It has a couple of awesome features such as a Home page, Featured page, New arrival page, footer area and a store for all the products. 

currently still thinking of new ways to improve the site.
here is the finish page so far : https://maiyopabz.github.io/e-commerce-store/
